General workflow

1. user enters webhook and summoner names
2. save webhook and list of associated summoner names
3. for each summoner, mark hasAttachedWebhooks=true (means it is being tracked)


Backend workflow

1. maintain a queue of summoners to check
2. check at most one every 2 seconds for active game
3. if summoner is in an active game, get all webhooks containing the summoner
4. update summoner lastQueried and lastGameId
5. send a post request to each webhook indicating the summoner is in game

Subprocess: 

2.1. in a subprocess, query mongo every 5 minutes for all hasAttachedWebhooks summoners 
2.2. for each, check lastQueried is more than 10 minutes ago
	2.2.1. if yes, add summoner to queue
	2.2.2. else skip and check next summoner


Summoner removal (when removing summoners from a list)

1. compare existing list with updated list
2. for each summoner: 
	2.1. check if it is still in another list
	2.2. if yes, just remove from current list
	2.3. if no, mark summoner hasAttachedWebhooks=false
